- **Anti-Stuck System**: Prevents vehicles from getting stuck on obstacles
- **Terrain Adaptation**: Adjusts to different terrain conditions
- **Smooth Controls**: Natural and realistic vehicle movement

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Unity project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AminHasanloo/Unity-AI-Vehicle-System.git
```

2. Import the following scripts into your Unity project:
   - `AIVehicleController.cs`
   - `VehicleController.cs`
   - `VehicleObstacleAvoidance.cs`
   - `VehicleReverseSystem.cs`
   - `VehiclesAntiStuckSystem.cs`

## üîß Setup

1. Create a vehicle GameObject in your scene
2. Add the required components:
   ```
   - Rigidbody
   - Wheel Colliders
   - AIVehicleController
   - VehicleObstacleAvoidance
   - VehicleReverseSystem
   ```
3. Configure the wheel settings in the inspector:
   - Set up wheel transforms
   - Configure wheel colliders
   - Adjust physics parameters

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### AIVehicleController
```csharp
[Header("AI Navigation")]
public float detectionRange = 50f;
public float obstacleDetectionRange = 20f;
public float sideDetectionRange = 8f;

[Header("Speed Settings")]
public float normalSpeed = 100f;
public float boostSpeed = 150f;
public float corneringSpeed = 70f;
```

### VehicleReverseSystem
```csharp
[Header("Reverse Detection")]
public float stuckCheckDuration = 2f;
public float minimumSpeedThreshold = 2f;
public float obstacleCheckDistance = 1.5f;

[Header("Turn Around Settings")]
public float quickTurnThreshold = 5f;
public float turnInPlaceForce = 800f;
```

## üéÆ Usage

1. Add a target object to your scene
2. Assign the target to the AI Vehicle Controller
3. Configure the layers for obstacle detection
4. Adjust the parameters to match your vehicle's characteristics

```csharp
// Example: Setting up the AI destination
aiVehicleController.destination = targetTransform;
```

## üîç Advanced Features

### Intelligent Path Finding
The system automatically calculates the optimal path to the target while avoiding obstacles:
- Checks for clearance before making turns
- Determines the best overtaking direction
- Adjusts speed based on path complexity

### Smart Reverse System
Handles complex situations where the vehicle needs to reverse:
- Detects when reverse is necessary
- Calculates safe reverse distance
- Manages multi-point turns

### Dynamic Speed Control
Automatically adjusts vehicle speed based on:
- Distance to target
- Upcoming turns
- Obstacle proximity
- Terrain conditions
